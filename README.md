Bachelor's Thesis: Pioneering Active Monitoring for Industrial Operations

My Bachelor's thesis involved developing an innovative Android prototype in Kotlin for real-time industrial machine monitoring. The application efficiently scans QR codes to identify machines, providing instant access to vital operational data such as temperature, speed, and pressure, ultimately enhancing proactive maintenance and efficiency.
